          <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-2">Better Performance</h2>
          <p>Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.</p>

        <div class="w-1/2 ml-4">
          <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-2">Higher Security</h2>
          <p>With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.</p>

          <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-2">Cheaper, Easier Scaling</h2>
          <p>When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.</p>

        <div class="w-1/2 ml-4">
          <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-2">Better DX</h2>
          <p>Loose coupling and separation of controls allow for more targeted development and debugging, and the expanding selection of CMS options for site generators remove the need to maintain a separate stack for content and marketing.</p>
